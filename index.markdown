# Data Lab Notes Code Projects!


## Personal Projects
<li><a href="https://github.com/MKS310/MTG-Web-Scraping/blob/master/README.md">Magic The Gathering Web Scraping and Natural Language Processing Project</a></li><br>
My family and I love playing Magic the Gathering, so I created this project for a final exam for an Unstructured Data Analysis Class during my Master's degree program. The goal was to analyze the deck structure of the tournament decks in the current "meta" (a term used to describe the current cards in popular use). I also wanted to analyze the text on the cards since MTG card narratives contain a lot of interesting Fantasy-genre descriptions.

<li><a href="https://github.com/MKS310/Hadoop_Project_2/blob/master/README.md">Big Data:High Performance Computing MapReduce Project</a></li><br>
In this project, I worked with input, output, Python and the MapReduce framework. The mappers and reducers to solve a few different problems, listed below.

### Background
The map function is stateless and this is especially important when dealing with Hadoop and distributed work. We canâ€™t guarantee that any 1 mapper will read in all of the data. Nor can we guarantee that certain input will end up on the same machine for mapping. Rather, 1 mapper will likely read in a small portion of the data. The output that the mapper produces must only depend on the current input value.

<li><a href="https://github.com/MKS310/Kaggle_Vietnam_Bombing/blob/master/README.md">Kaggle Vietnam Bombing Data Analysis with Pig Scripting</a></li><br>
This project required using Pig scripts in a Hadoop environment on a large dataset. The task was to ask a 3 questions about a large dataset and answer them using the Apache Pig language.

With the following analysis, I demonstrate how data-driven analysis requires domain knowledge and investigation. A Data Analysis is driven by questions and research into a topic.

### Background
I downloaded a kaggle data set containing declassified U.S. military bombing operation data from the Vietnam War. The data was declassified in 2000 by President Clinton. I wanted to analyze accuracy of reported events using Apache Hadoop and Pig.

## Corporate/Industry Projects

I was a Data Scientist in the Engineering R&D Department of an Automotive Manufacturer for 3-years. Unfortunately, the code and work produced is all proprietary and ownded by the company. However, these links point to the high-level descriptions of the accomplishments of myself and the team I worked with! <br><br>

# Data Lab Notes Projects!

This is the home page :)
<br>
And is currently Under Construction! 
<br>
In the mean time, here is a project from my time in grad school:

<li><a href="https://github.com/MKS310/MTG-Web-Scraping/blob/master/schweihs_text.pdf">Magic The Gathering Web Scraping and Natural Language Processing Project</a></li>

I spent some years in industry after that, so not much public information is available, but this article provides a high level overview of some of the work I did:

<li> From the Dataiku Blog: <a href="https://www.dataiku.com/stories/detail/oshkosh/">A Traditional Organization + a Modern Data Science Practice: The Oshkosh Story</a></li>

<li> From the Oshkosh Corporation Website: <a href="https://oshkoshdefense.com/services/life-cycle-management/">Condition Based Maintenance (CBM) and CBM + Technology</a></li>

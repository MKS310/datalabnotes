Data Management for IoT is ü§Ø

  

But I think Knowledge Graphs can help!

  

The goal with any data system is to move from raw data to information to knowledge to wisdom/insight/action (choose your pinnacle verb).

  

This often requires layers of data storage and processing.

  

The industry has, over time, developed concepts and abstraction layers that quickly become a buzzword soup: database, data warehouse, data lake, data mesh, data fabric, digital twin, digital thread, semantic layer, centralized data, federated systems ü§Ø

  

Though I think it's important to avoid unnecessary complexity, there are a lot of advantages to developing a layered system that moves from raw data to insight quickly.

  

üò∫ A few weeks ago [Joseph A di Paolantonio](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/#) piqued my curiosity about the possibilities of knowledge graphs, so I have been digging in and learning some of the fundamentals about this semantic representation and how it can add value to IoT.

  

üí° I think the biggest light-bulb moment for me was learning about the Semantic Web (i.e. a massive knowledge graph):

  

"Sometimes known as Web 3.0, it is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards set by the World Wide Web Consortium. The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable." (Wikipedia)

  

Google has promoted the idea of the semantic web and has been moving from an index-based search engine to a semantic search engine since 2012.

  

üßê The connection I am making is that the IoT is an Internet.....of Things. So, if Google is using Knowledge Graphs to manage the metadata about the Internet.....We might want to think about how Knowledge Graphs can manage metadata for the IoT.

  

If you see the advantages of semantic search and the semantic web, then the advantages of knowledge graphs for IoT follow!

# I Asked ChatGPT for Advice on my Portfolio
## It gave me a pretty clear roadmap

Prompt: i am a data scientist who wants to apply to PhD programs. I am writing a blog and working on a personal website that focuses on data science for IoT and digital twins. what are some projects I could do to build a portfolio to help apply to graduate school

Response: Great to hear that you are working on building a portfolio to apply to PhD programs! Here are some project ideas that you could work on to showcase your skills and expertise in data science for IoT and digital twins:

1.  Build a predictive maintenance model for an IoT device: Develop a model to predict when an IoT device might fail or need maintenance. This could involve analyzing data from the device's sensors, as well as external data sources such as weather data, to predict when the device is likely to need maintenance.
    
2.  Develop a digital twin for a manufacturing process: Create a virtual replica of a real-world manufacturing process using data collected from sensors and other sources. Use this digital twin to simulate different scenarios and optimize the process.
	1.  What process? 
		1. Digital twin of weather data
		2. weather + biometric
		3.  digital twin of the night sky + weather
		4. biometric tetris
		5. sunset powered camera, record timelapse of sunsets over long period of time
		6. sensor triggered timelapse
		
    
3.  Analyze data from smart home devices: Collect data from a variety of smart home devices, such as thermostats, lighting systems, and security cameras. Analyze this data to identify patterns and trends, and develop recommendations for optimizing energy usage and improving security.
	1. plants
	2. humidity sensors in sub-tropical climate (+ air conditioners = causal?)
    
4.  Build a machine learning model to detect anomalies in sensor data: Develop a model to detect anomalies in sensor data collected from IoT devices. This could involve using techniques such as clustering, anomaly detection, or deep learning to identify patterns in the data and flag any unusual readings.
	1. plants
	2. weather
	3. 
    
5.  Develop a dashboard to monitor IoT devices: Build a web-based dashboard to monitor the performance of IoT devices in real-time. Use data visualization tools to display key metrics and identify any issues that require attention.
	1. family tetris dashboard = app to input metrics, 
    

These projects should help you build a strong portfolio that showcases your skills in data science for IoT and digital twins. Good luck with your applications!

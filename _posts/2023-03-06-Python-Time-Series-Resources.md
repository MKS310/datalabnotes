# Python Time Series Resources
## A living document of Python time series resources



## Forecasting

[Facebook Prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/) is a forecasting procedure impomented in R and Python. It set an industry standard for explainable, scalable, and user-friendly forecasting frameworks.

Code: [prophet on GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/prophet)



[NeuralProphet](https://neuralprophet.com/) is a python library for forecasting time series data based on Neural Network with PyTorch. The library, as the name implies, was inspired by FaceBook's Prophet library.

## Clustering

### Agglomerative clustering

### Time series K-Means

### Kernel K-means

### K-means DBA Clustering

### K-medoid clustering

### Dynamic Time warping (DTW)



## Anomaly Detection

[Stumpy](https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a powerful and scalable Python library that efficiently computes something called the [matrix profile](https://stumpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorial_The_Matrix_Profile.html), which is just an academic way of saying “for every (green) subsequence within your time series, automatically identify its corresponding nearest-neighbor (grey)”

# Hello World!
##Overcomplicating my blog for the sake of simplicity

#blogging #zettlekasten #github #jekyll

I spent way too much time this weekend setting up a whole new area of my blog, and you're reading it. It's **another** blog under the "projects" subdomain: projects.datalabnotes.com. It's a Jekyll blog hosted on my GitHub account. The goal is to keep more code and technical articles over here, so they can be easily accessible as jupyter notebooks.

I have a local repo of the blog, so I can save obsidian notes right in the blog posts folder and push them to publish. I can also use a jupyter to markdown converter and generate markdown files from notebooks, yay!

Some cool things about the process of setting this up are
1. Reaqcuainting myself with all of these tools and setting them up, sometimes 3 or 4 times, so that they work the way I want. 
2. Using git regularly! Git is an amazing tool and its fun to work locally and create automated workflows. The productivity gains are huge. 

Will I continue to write on the main domain, datalabnotes.com, through the Wordpress CMS? Yes, of course! the look and feel of the theme over there are great and I don't even want to try to create that functionality in a Jekyll blog! Each one has it's place.

The #1 goal this week will be to get some code out here! Let's goooo!!!
